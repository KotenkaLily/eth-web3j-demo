# eth-web3j-demo
A demo into eth with web3j.
truffle or eth node needed.

This project is only for study, and as a demo.

#### Truffle node

```
metacoin/
This directory is almost just from truffle official example.
```

##### Details

Please read docs/

Ok they are Chinese.

#### JAVA

The ERC20Controller.java, BlockChainInfoController.java are both from :

```
触不可及
newonexd
https://github.com/newonexd

from his blog indeed, not from the github.
https://www.cnblogs.com/cbkj-xd/p/16413245.html
```

But there are some very tiny bugs... That I fixed the naming of some params, and separate the functions to service/.

##### Mongo

The MongoDB part is never important, just my test, so just remove it if it's unnecessary.



#### WEB

It's

```
web/

build with vue-cli, write in vue3,ant-design-vue etc.
```

The web page refers to 

```
https://tronscan.org/
```

only a home page and two pictures.

If it's not proper to do that, contact me to delete the page.

While since it's just a page and this project is simply a demo, I think it's ok...
